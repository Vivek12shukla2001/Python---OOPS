It focuses on four main principles: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n","\n","2.What is a class in OOP?\n","\n",">A class in OOP is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of the objects created from it.\n","\n","3.What is an object in OOP?\n","\n",">An object is an instance of a class. It contains real-world entities and behaviors as defined by its class.\n","\n","4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","\n",">Abstraction is the concept of hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object.\n","\n",">Encapsulation is the practice of wrapping data and methods within a class to prevent direct access and modification from outside the class.\n","\n","5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n","\n",">Dunder (double underscore) methods in Python, also known as magic methods, are special methods that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __repr__). They allow customization of class behavior.\n","\n","6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n","\n",">Inheritance is an OOP feature that allows a class (child class) to derive properties and behaviors from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and hierarchical classification.\n","\n","7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","\n",">Polymorphism is the ability of a function, method, or object to take multiple forms. It allows the same interface to be used for different data types or classes.\n","\n","8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","\n","Encapsulation in Python is achieved using access modifiers:\n","\n","Public (variable): Accessible anywhere.\n","\n","Protected (_variable): Intended for internal use but accessible.\n","\n","Private (__variable): Not directly accessible outside the class.\n","\n","\n","9.What is a constructor in Python?\n","\n",">A constructor is a special method (__init__) in a class that is automatically called when a new object is created. It initializes the objectâ€™s attributes.\n","\n","10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n","\n",">Class methods (@classmethod): Methods that take cls as the first parameter and can modify class-level attributes.\n","\n",">Static methods (@staticmethod): Methods that do not operate on the class or instance; they work independently.\n","\n","11.What is method overloading in Python?\n","\n",">Python does not support traditional method overloading. However, it can be simulated using default parameters, variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs), or function overloading with decorators.\n","\n","12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n","\n",">Method overriding occurs when a child class redefines a method from its parent class, providing a specific implementation.\n","\n","13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n","\n",">The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed as an attribute, promoting controlled access to private variables.\n","\n","14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n","\n","Polymorphism enhances flexibility and scalability by allowing objects of different types to be treated uniformly.\n","\n","15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n","\n",">An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains at least one abstract method. It is defined using the ABC module.\n","\n","16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n","\n","1.Code reusability through inheritance\n","\n","2.Improved maintainability and scalability\n","\n","3.Encapsulation enhances security\n","\n","4.Abstraction simplifies complex problems\n","\n","17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","\n",">Class variable: Shared across all instances of a class.\n","\n","Instance variable: Unique to each instance.\n","\n","18.19What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","\n",">Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling access to multiple base class attributes and methods.\n","\n","19.Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n","\n","__str__: Returns a human-readable string representation of an object.\n","\n","__repr__: Returns an unambiguous string representation used for debugging.\n","\n","20.What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n","\n","The super() function allows access to parent class methods and constructors, facilitating method overriding and multiple inheritance.\n","\n","21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",">The __del__ method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing resource cleanup.\n","\n","22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","\n","@staticmethod: Does not access class or instance attributes.\n","\n","@classmethod: Works with class-level attributes using cls.\n","\n","23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","\n",">polymorphism allows methods in child classes to override methods in parent classes, enabling different behavior while maintaining a common interface.\n","\n","24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","\n","Method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement.\n","\n","25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","\n","The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be invoked as a function, enabling callable objects.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6PZhhv7WDAPI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"LFmVty-3COEx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Practical Questions"],"metadata":{"id":"VqDJLTVmCF8A"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1.
